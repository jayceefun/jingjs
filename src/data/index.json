The focus here is on building a practical, working application, along with demonstrating the setup of a JavaScript MVC app, and some Node conventions for code.",

I'll start with the model layer, Geddy's ORM (object-relational mapper) -- showing how Node's asynchronous programming paradigm works with database-access, and then moving on to Geddy's query API, and database migrations for schema changes. Next I'll show how to use the retrieved data to render a response -- either structured data (like JSON), or rendering HTML templates.",

What was happening in the early 90s that made Brendan Eich reach for prototypes rather than classes when designing his new language?",

Self is an ambitious language that, among other things, introduced prototypal OOP to the programming world. What lessons can we learn from this early pioneer of prototypal languages? Can we write better Javascript by understanding Self’s goals and approach to programming? Let’s explore the ambitions of Self and see if we can suss out the advantages and disadvantages of the prototypal approach and apply what we find to our own Javascript writing."

Now, however, as more and more application logic move from the server to the client our main problem is that we need to unlearn our earlier DOM-centric approach to JavaScript. Tools such as Backbone and Angular help, but before we are able to use the effectively we have to change some of our neural pathways. In this talk I will look at a couple of patterns that will help you move away from jQuery spaghetti and get you started on a foundation for building large-scale JavaScript applications."
